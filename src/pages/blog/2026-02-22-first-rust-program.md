Today I shipped my first Rust program in my test branch and got the full workflow running end-to-end.

That was the warm-up.

Next, I’ll be working on this challenge repository:

- <https://github.com/mir-am/cg4j-rust-challenge>

Challenge focus:

- **A Java Call Graph Generator in Rust**

I’ll post progress updates here as I move from scaffolding to implementation.
